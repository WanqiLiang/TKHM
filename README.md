Some problem I resolved with this repo:

1. separate frontend/backend without CORS error

2. submit form-data type rather than JSON

### Framework

1. frontend is made with ReactJs, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2. backend is made with Flask

### To run

No other package used other than flask

cd into the backend folder, run command python app.py

in another terminal, cd into the frontend folder, run 'npm start'

### Functionality

paste the conversation into the text area, hit submit, then the conversation Analysis would give the longest two sentences in the conversation.
